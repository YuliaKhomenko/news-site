                HOUSAND OAKS, Calif. — A gunman firing seemingly at random killed a dozen people inside a crowded country-music bar here late Wednesday, authorities said, a toll that included a sheriff’s deputy who had raced inside to confront the attacker.
                Authorities said the gunman — identified as Ian David Long, a 28-year-old Marine veteran who was cleared by a mental-health specialist after an encounter with police earlier this year — was found dead inside after apparently killing himself. Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said Thursday morning that investigators have not been able to determine a motive.
                The bloodshed spread throughout the Borderline Bar and Grill, a popular nightspot in Thousand Oaks, Calif., a city near Los Angeles. When the gunfire began, people were line dancing during the venue’s “College Country Night,” witnesses said. That detail evoked the massacre of 58 people at a country-music festival in Las Vegas a little more than a year earlier — a connection deepened when some of those who escaped Borderline said they had also survived that massacre.
                Police said Long, wearing a black sweater and wielding a 45-caliber Glock handgun with an extended magazine, approached the bar and shot a security guard standing outside. He then headed in and shot other employees before turning his fire on patrons, Dean said.
                “It’s a horrific scene in there,” Dean, who is set to retire Friday night, told reporters. “There’s blood everywhere.”</h1>
